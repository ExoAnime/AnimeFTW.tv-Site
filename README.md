## Synopsis

This is the AnimeFTW.tv website in its final state. Eventually I will get around to cleaning it up so that people can use it as a seed, but for the time being feel free to poke around and laugh.

## Bleeding Eyes Notice

The site was developed in 4 different coding styles, sadly, the first was done back in 2007 when i was brand new to the scene. As I learned more I ended up creating lots of code bloat. The best code i've ever done to this day has to be the API, so if you want something redeeming check out the api v2 (not v1, dear god don't go there)!

## Motivation

AnimeFTW.tv was my baby, for nearly 10 years the site was able to give those that couldn't torrent the ability to enjoy content previously only procured from torrents.

## Installation

At the moment there is no installation instructions, over time ill build out an installer which will install the schema along with the dynamics necessary for proper maintenance.

## API Reference

If you are able to get the site up and running, the v2 api documentation can be found here:
http://docs.animeftwtv.apiary.io/

## Contributors

A lot of people contributed code to the site, we want to thank them all.

## License

There is no license, use this code (that may cause cancer) at your own risk!
